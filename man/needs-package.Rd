\title{Easier package loading / auto-installation}
\description{
\strong{needs} is a simple R function to make package loading /
installation hassle-free --- use it in place of \code{library} to attach
packages and automatically install any that are missing. You can also supply
a minimum version number, and it will update old packages as needed. No more
changing your code to reinstall packages every time you update R ---
\code{needs} does it for you.
