\usage{
needs(..., .print_conflicts = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Packages, given as unquoted names or character strings. Specify a
required package version as \code{package = "version"}.}

\item{.print_conflicts}{Logical, specifying whether to print a summary of
objects that exist in multiple places on the search path along with their
respective locations. Set to \code{TRUE} to identify any masked functions.
Objects in the base package and the global environment are ignored.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\description{
\code{needs} loads and attaches packages, automatically
  installing (and attaching) any it can't find in your libraries. It accepts
  any number of arguments, given as names or character strings. Optionally,
  supply a minimum version on a per-package basis to update old packages as
  needed.
}
\details{
Recommended use is to allow the function to autoload when prompted
  the first time the package is loaded interactively. To change this setting
  later, run \code{needs:::autoload(TRUE)} or \code{needs:::autoload(FALSE)}
  to turn autoloading on or off, respectively.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
needs()   # returns NULL

needs(foo, bar)

# require a minimum version
needs(foo,
      bar = "0.9.1",
      baz = "0.4.3")
